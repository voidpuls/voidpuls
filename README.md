# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a high school student (graduating class of 2025) with a passion for coding and building cool projects.  I love exploring new technologies and expanding my skillset.

I'm currently focused on web development and particularly enjoy working with:

* **JavaScript:**  I'm comfortable with both front-end and some back-end JavaScript development.

I'm always learning and looking for new challenges.  Feel free to check out my repositories to see what I've been working on.  I'm open to collaboration and always excited to connect with other developers!
